Created a simple chatbot using Langgraph, used tools here wikipedia wrapper and arxiv wrapper along with LLM, 
where : if the information is not available with LLM, it can fethch the information from tools and give to user at the time of retrieving the answer. 
require APIs keys of Groq, Langchain
I used Gemma2-9b-It, you can use any other LLM model too
